2. CREATE EC2 INSTANCE/SERVER/VM
- LAUNCH INSTANCES (ORANGE BUTTON)
- NAME THE INSTANCE/EC2/SERVER ANYTHING (COMPUTE NAME IS ALL THAT MATTERS TO AWS)

3. COPY PUBLIC DNS---> WHERE EC2 WILL BE ACCESSIBLE OVER THE INTERNET--->PASTE INTO NOTE SOFTWARE FIRST!-->TYPE http:// in browser-->PASTE PUBLIC DNS--->FULL SEND
- ec2-18-222-149-159.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com (didn't work because we used the default security group)
- http://ec2-18-223-134-115.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com/ (worked with the new security group)

<-----TROUBLESHOOTING----->
	•	MAKE SURE THAT DNS IS AUTO-ASSIGNED (BOX CHECKED)
	•	MAKE SURE ADDRESS prefix IS http:// NOT https://
