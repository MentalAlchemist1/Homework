Terraform pt. 7: S3 Hosted webpage

goal = create an S3 bucet and host a custom public webpage

deliverables = link of functional S-3 hosted webpage

S3 can do a lot
- Simple Storage Service
- hosting objects/images
- static webpage/html file

1. Create a bucket: ai-engineering-corpus
2. Upload desired files
3. Check a file for testing
	- check box
	- click Copy URL![xml](images/Screenshot-2025-12-16-at-7.48.28-PM.png)
		- access denied due to bucket permissions
4. Go to Properties
	1. bottom...Static website hosting
	2. Edit
	3. Enable - site will be determined by the html file you point to = <font color="#ff0000">index.html (MUST SPECIFY THIS SPECIFIC NAME)</font>. 
		1. Can name it whatever you want but the object name has to equal the Index document name

Go to Permissions tab

Turn OFF Block public access (bucket settings)...still error
![403 forbidden](images/Screenshot-2025-12-16-at-8.05.24-PM.png)
Now, modify the ACLs
- Permissions tab, Object Ownership
- bucket owner enforced
	- "ACLs are disabled. All objects in this bucket are owned by this account. Access to this bucket and its objects is specified using only policies."
- modify object ownership, enable ACL
	- why? to be able to edit the Access control list![object ownership](images/Screenshot-2025-12-16-at-8.12.42-PM.png)

![acl](images/Pasted-image-20251216201444.png)
- want people to have access to bucket so we have to change the Grantee from this:
![edit acl](images/Screenshot-2025-12-16-at-8.16.05-PM.png)
to this...![edit acl](images/Pasted-image-20251216201732.png)
Last step...make the objects visible via ACLs

Recap
- Permissions tab = we allowed public access
- Object Ownership tab = enabled ACLs
- Edited ACLs, giving everyone access to BUCKET, not OBJECTS
- Choose objects, Actions, Make Public using ACL

Now have a functioning S3 static webpage/site.

NOTE: if you want to change the picture, make sure to UPLOAD a NEW index.html file with a changed image source (i.e. img src=). It will overwrite if you have Versioning turned on.![index html](images/Screenshot-2025-12-16-at-9.18.26-PM.png)
